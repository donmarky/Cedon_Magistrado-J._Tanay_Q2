# Creature Power Levels Sorting Program

## Overview
This Java program is designed as Quiz 2 for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. It allows users to input the power levels of 10 creatures, sorts these levels using both bubble sort and selection sort algorithms, and performs an analysis of the power levels. The program displays the sorted lists, calculates the sum of even and odd power levels, and identifies the minimum and maximum power levels.

## Features
- Input of 10 integer power levels.
- Sorting of power levels in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- Sorting of power levels in descending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.
- Calculation and display of:
  - Sum of even power levels.
  - Sum of odd power levels.
  - Minimum power level.
  - Maximum power level.

## Breakdown of Roles

### Part 1: Input and Bubble Sort
**Cedon, Romark L.** was responsible for:
- Implementing the input functionality where the user can enter 10 power levels of creatures.
- Writing the **Bubble Sort** algorithm to sort the power levels in **ascending order**.
- Took responsibility for **finalizing the code**.
- Ensured the code was correct, handled debugging, and checked that all parts of the program worked seamlessly together.


### Part 2: Selection Sort and Displaying the Array
**Magistrado, Jonan Leonel B.** was responsible for:
- Implementing the **Selection Sort** algorithm to sort the array in **descending order**.
- Developing the `displayArray()` function to show the sorted arrays after both Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.

### Part 3: Analyzing Power Levels
**Tanay, Xyja Alexandrea G.** was responsible for:
- Writing the **analyzePowerLevels()** function to perform the analysis on the array of power levels.
- The analysis includes calculating the sum of even and odd numbers, as well as finding the minimum and maximum power levels in the array.
