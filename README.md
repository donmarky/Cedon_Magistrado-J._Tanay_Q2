# Creature Power Levels Sorting Program

## Overview
This Java program is designed as Quiz 2 for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. It allows users to input the power levels of 10 creatures, sorts these levels using both bubble sort and selection sort algorithms, and performs an analysis of the power levels. The program displays the sorted lists, calculates the sum of even and odd power levels, and identifies the minimum and maximum power levels.

## Features
- Input of 10 integer power levels.
- Sorting of power levels in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- Sorting of power levels in descending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.
- Calculation and display of:
  - Sum of even power levels.
  - Sum of odd power levels.
  - Minimum power level.
  - Maximum power level.
